# typescript-app
This is a front end to a web application using reactjs and typescript technologies and dependencies managed with webpack. With MaterialUI instead of bootstrap to lay out the pages. Bear in mind that this is front end and that the backend I wrote in java using spring boot framework

In order to cut down in total file size hosted on here and due to necessity I have removed the dependencies which can be readded locally if you have nodejs installed simply by the commands,

First navigate to the project directory then,

  npm install #this will download the node dependencies and generate package.lock.json
  
To run the app locally in development mode we run the command:

  npm run dev

To build the app to its production varient we run:

  npm run build
